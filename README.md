# Useful-Assets-Tools
These are some useful files to give convenience in Unity game-making.

Drag the "MSYH SDF.asset" file into "Assets" folder of your own Unity project, and it should be able to be selected as your TextMeshPro Chinese font.
If it doesn't work, try to use the .TXT file and the font in your own PC to create one in Unity. There should be some Tutorials on Internet.
